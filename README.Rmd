# lookups

### 👋 Welcome to the `lookups` package!

Thank you for using `lookups`. This package was designed to be a "single source of truth" for health and geography data across Wales. Our goal is to save you time and reduce errors by providing clean, standardized, and ready-to-use datasets for your analysis.

Whether you are mapping patient postcodes or aggregating data by Primary Care Clusters, `lookups` has you covered!

## 📦 What does this package do?

The `lookups` package eliminates the need to manually hunt for CSVs on StatsWales or external websites. It stores optimized, pre-cleaned versions of essential Welsh datasets directly within R.

With a single function—`use_lookup()`—you can instantly access:

* **GP Practice Master List:** A comprehensive directory of all Welsh GP surgeries, including their national codes (`WCode`), official names, and their mappings to **Primary Care Clusters** and **Health Boards**.
* **WIMD 2025:** The latest Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation data. This includes ranks, deciles, quintiles, and specialized **Urban/Rural flags** for every LSOA in Wales.
* **Postcode to LSOA Mapping:** A lightning-fast lookup for Welsh postcodes (2021 boundaries) that allows you to join patient-level data to geographic and deprivation markers instantly.
* **Schools Master List:** A verified list of all educational institutions in Wales, categorized by type (Maintained, Independent, PRU) and Local Authority.
