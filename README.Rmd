# lookups

### 👋 Welcome to the `lookups` package!

Thank you for using `lookups`. This package is designed to be a "one stop shop" for all your data lookup needs. Our goal is to save you time and reduce errors by providing clean, standardized, and ready-to-use datasets for your analysis.

## 📦 What does this package do?

The `lookups` package eliminates the need to manually hunt for CSVs on StatsWales or external websites. It stores optimized, pre-cleaned versions of essential Welsh datasets directly within R.

With a single function—`use_lookup()`—you can instantly access:

* **GP Practice Master List:** A comprehensive directory of all Welsh GP surgeries, including their `wcode`, official names, and their mappings to **Clusters** and **Health Boards**.

* **WIMD 2025 and Urban/Rural Status:** The latest Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation data. This includes ranks, deciles, quintiles, and specialized **Urban/Rural flags** for every LSOA in Wales.

* **Postcode to LSOA Mapping:** A lightning-fast lookup for Welsh postcodes (2021 boundaries) that allows you to join postcodes to Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)

* **Schools Master List:** A list of all schools in Wales, categorized by Postcodes and Local Authority.
